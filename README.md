## 📌 Branch Strategy

The project follows a **Git Flow** strategy with adaptations for a "pre" branch. The main branches are:

- **`main`** → Contains stable production code.
- **`develop`** → Main development branch with integrated code.
- **`pre`** → (Optional) For testing before merging into `main`, if requested by the pre team.
- **`feature/*`** → For developing new features.
- **`bugfix/*`** → For fixing bugs in `develop`.
- **`hotfix/*`** → For urgent fixes in `main`.

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Open an **issue** in the repository to discuss the task with the team.
2. If the task is approved, it will be assigned to you, and you can create a branch `feature/feature-name`, `bugfix/bug-name`, or `hotfix/hotfix-name` based on `develop` or `main`, as appropriate.
3. Develop and ensure you follow the code conventions.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to `develop` when ready.
5. The code will be reviewed and tested before being merged.
